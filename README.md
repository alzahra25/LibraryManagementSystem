# Library Management System - DB Project (Part 1)

## Contents
- ERD & Schema Design
- SQL Scripts (DDL, DML, DQL)
- Normalization Proof
- Error Testing Log

## Description
A backend-focused simulation of a full Library Management System using SQL. This includes schema setup, data simulation, realistic query writing, and failure testing.

## Developer Reflection
- Most challenging: Enforcing referential integrity while keeping deletion flexible.
- Learned most from: ON DELETE CASCADE and CHECK constraints.
- Error log insights: Realized the importance of constraint handling in maintaining data integrity.
